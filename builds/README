               FIXED: vpn-pbr users should stay on 3.1 (now locally fixed 61-70+) 


           3.2.107   =   current (RELEASE_NOTES)
           3.2.55>3.2.61-30+>3.2.100
           [r16904/r17073]
           3.2.61.20[<2.55?] older versions likely has some known bugs


           3.2 introduces config-network-device changes as seen in
           21.02... if starting(ed) on(pre) 3.1... it is possible
           to upgrade<->downgrade

    ################################################## builds


    WHAT-IS-IT?: disk images of openwrt for the rpi-4... see thread
                 or ../README for installation tips... based on
                 snapshot(master) they include;

                    -common drivers ( usb nic / lte / etc. )
                    -larger default partitions
                    -luci + luci-theme-argon
                    -applications
                    -some installation/setup tweaks and customisations

 
    IMAGE-TYPES:

        "sys" = sysupgrade
        "fac" = factory



      VARIANTS:

                 * 'extra/full' and
                 * 'std/basic/halffull' (periodic due to low demand)

             recommended to use the 'extra/full' as these will likely throw out
             the packagesrestore logic and there are no markers within the image
             re: variant... ( note: if you did a fresh install with the std/basic
             variant and always use this variant then above would not apply )



    ################################################ versioning notes
        
        r12345 = openwrt checkout revision
        1.x.x  = community version
        x.N.x  = community something major changed (vermagix, major patches for bcm2711 etc.)
        23456  = files revision
        



    
        any folder labelled beta,testing,unstable etc... can be ignored unless you are feeling
        lucky...

        upgrading on each (stable) release is not really beneficial unless you are feeling lucky,
        need a feature, are a power user or would like to help with testing / ironing out bugs...


        history seems to indicate that every 5-10 builds or so there are enough changes either to
        community package-set/features or official code to justify upgrading...
        or ~r15xxx(yourversion)

                +100-250(smallchanges especially for packages)
                +350-550(likely some target changes)
                +700+(fair amount of change and major bugfixes)

        however... on master a single commit can also change something important... build wise
        these kinds of changes generally are posted at the top of this document or on the
        forum thread... and where relavent build numbers are changed/or are labelled as test

             and your current PARTUUID (blkid) to verify it is correct
             /dev/mmcblk0p2 is ok for mmconly usage

             factory installs disregard

            -novice-users / anyone using the build in a production capacity are advised
             wait for a week or two or use factory only on newdisk
             factory installs disregard

            -non-factory installation (sysupgrade) and wish to switch disk around later
             update cmdline.txt with root=PARTUUID=abcdefgh-0N AFTER install
             $> blkid $(findmnt /) #to get partuuid

             (note: if you started on mmc flash this and stay on mmc then root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 if fine )


            -use a low power requirement usb disk (non-mmc users)

            -see forum-post/rpi-documentation re: boot-order... by default... the mmc needs to
             be removed in order to attempt to load from usb drive
            
            -if you get no boot and have no serial plug into a pc -> fsck ->
             mount fatpart1/boot -> check your PARTUUID / cmdline.txt
             root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 is fine for mmc-only use...
             for dual use or usb only dont rely on /dev/sdX



        KNOWN-ISSUES:
            -argon theme splash page intermittent on reboot
             i've limited it to twice but old scripts are orphaned... need to poke
             around upstream a little of fix in next few weeks

        FIXED-ISH:

       USB-PARTUUID-VERBOSE-NOTES


                -as above re:uas/ssd likely existed on older builds also
                -probable luci_statistics minor oddities or manual migration / refresh / required

                best tried on a new usb/mmc disk ( it is not specific to usb
                and makes the disk pluggable either way  )... or dd backup
                your mmc if you are game to sysupgrade over that... ( due 
                to cmdline.txt being part of the backup... you'd have to 
                update your root=PARTUUID=ABCDEFGH-02 this is not mandatory
                and only really help is the disk is inserted / copied to a
                non-mmc slot  )

            -best flashed to a new disk... (but sysupgrade capable with hand edit of cmdline.txt)

            -note: on usb2 flashing takes approx 12mins + 3mins for firstboot init
             ( approx 3xslower dont have usb3-disk to test with )
             correction... that was a usb3-sdreader... usb3-ssd@5years old is comparable to mmc
             read seems faster

            -if you restore config files... do not restore cmdline.txt ( clone/setup root=PARTUUID= )

            -if you use sysupgrade on your existing mmc... optional but recommended to update your
                 cmdline.txt also to root=PARTUUID= AND make a 'dd' dump+backup of your mmc card
                 in it's original state
            
            -also recommended to have serial access just in case ( will be needed for debugging/support )
                
            -fwiw my boot order is inverted to try usb first then mmc (0xf14)
            
            -any requests for support should state;
               -you used a factory/sysupgrade to install?
               -what cmdline.txt/partuuid was before and is now
               -where the disk was plugged into before and is now
               -console boot output and your (pi)firmware version





    more detailed comments
    ################################################ cmdline.txt restore caveat 2.7.23+

    if you restore a backup from a different 'disk' (factory) you will need to
    check / manually repair /boot/cmdline.txt root= prior to reboot if it is
    set to PARTUUID or you will be using the new disk as alternate usb/mmc

    short term I recommend not intermixing backups per disk
    ( use a new and preferably different build for usb )

    or if you never intend to use usb you can change the cmdline.txt back to
    root=/dev/mmcblk0p2

    vice versa if you are switching to usb you should update your root=PARTUUID
    to that of the disk prior to unplugging / dd in this case you should only
    have one instance of that disk plugged in at a time... 



    ################################################ uuid(real) caveat

    not yet writing new real UUID so you may need to do that if you
    have config/fstab mounts and mmc + usb installs plugged
    in at the same time

           3.2 introduces config-network-device changes as seen in
           21.02... if starting(ed) on(pre) 3.1... it is possible
           to upgrade<->downgrade

           on downgrade an 'old' copy of your network settings is restored 
           so any changes made on the new version/s are reverted

           if starting(factory) on 21.02||3.2 it is not possible to downgrade

           changing UPGRADEsFLAVOUR="current" #or stable will allow you
           to toggle between stable||current if two are defined;
