         3.2.100 ROOTFSEXPAND > default adding takes effect on second upgrade


                  -changes made to the AUTORESTORE(packages) logix may be unusual
                   mostly around no restore then restore toggling

                      1: moves /etc/config/opkg if AUTORESTORE is off
                         (apologies if you use vgaetera's script independantly
                          i need to use another name for that file)
                      2: random removal of acme on my system unable to determine
                         the cause as yet... may revert all these changes
                         depending on further fallout

                 UPDATE: may have resolved the above

        ############################################################################## 3.1.30ish?

        WWWMODS:            Not wanting to delay the current version any longer
                            3.1.57-23 contains some www features that are not
                            yet parameterized.

                            For the uber-security concious... please use
                            #> rpi-support.sh nowwwmods
                            the pages are authenticated albeit fairly alpha-ish 



        NEWINIOPTIONS:      To remove auth from YOUTUBEDL you can use
                             YOUTUBEDL_NOAUTH=1

                             DLWRAPPER=1 #firstboot-setup-only
                                          caches adblock and banip lists
                                          weekly





         KNOWNISSUES:       eeprom-update via luci (or 'rpi4_eeprom.sh updaterecommended')
                             -excludes vl805
                             -runs regardless of whether an update is needed
                              use sparingly or use the direct command
                              $> rpi-eeprom-update -a




        POSSIBLEVFATISSUE:  not really confirmed but attempted to use a new usbstick
                            (Product:  SanDisk 3.2Gen1) and df -h would freeze/take
                            a long time with its default filesystem (vfat)
                            Possible false positive as was setting up block mount
                            so may have been double mounted or something


        ############################################################################## 3.1.17ish

        NEWINIOPTIONS:      You may wish to enable RMMOD="" or may wish to disable
                            OPKGFEEDS_USEHTTP=1 (faster) if enabled

        UPDATENOTICECHANGE: builds after 2.9.17-116 will contain some small changes to the
        (rollingout)        update checking and notification code...

                            anticipate some teething issues with old versions

                            please pm me on the forum or post on the thread if you see odd
                            behavior...

        BACKUPFEATURE:      The backup feature in the above notice makes files available for
                            download at http://IP/backup this may or may not pose some
                            security concerns (typically internal lan related only) depending
                            on your environment... if you use this feature... you can;
                            
                                  click 'refresh' after downloading the file
                            
                            to remove and clear...
                            These files are currently store on /tmp so reboot will also
                            clear...

                                 For best compatibility they specifically exclude;

                                       -/etc/rc.local
                                       -/boot/cmdline.txt
