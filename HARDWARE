    TYPICALSETUP:
    
        -rpi4 ( 2/1/4 all are fine 8 is untested but should be fine )
		 ( 1gb version may run into troubles with certain build features
           but fundamentally its hardware can do anything the others can
           do on openwrt )
         ( personally running 2GB but this was to save money and it
           limits re-use options down the track... if in doubt
           get the 4 )

          20210715 note: cm4-dfrobot-carrier rtl1111 support added
                         1g-nowifi-nommc(lite) model tested by @SyntaxTerror


        -PSU decent 3amp(2.5) psu ( external switch/button very handy )

        -HEATSINK small heatsink minimum ( fine without it tho' )

            
        -SDCARD    -> Samsung EVO Plus 32GB microSDXC UHS-I Class 10
         (note: 2 cards are beneficial)

		 ( if you intend to run from usb... do not use ssd drives
           or at least without external power and if you have issues
           test with a normal (low-power) usb key )


        -EXTERNAL-AP: anyone who seriously needs wireless should use a seperate ap
            ( ipq806x / unify ap's / tp-link 225/245 recommended )

        -WAN-Ethernet: For best results use a usb nic rtl-8152-3 / asix-ax88179
            recommended; (note: advise to retain default eth1 is wan settings )
            -> TP-LINK UE300 USB3
            
        -optional-case



    WISEMOVE:


        -a usb stick in the upper usb3 slot used as "backup/persistent"
         storage for anything that might not survive a failed upgrade...

        -this external extra data partition is encouraged for most
         openwrt devices with a usb slot... ( as is images that
         contain the required packages / drivers to access this
         data on a fresh install i.e. block-mount e2fsprogs etc. )
         these packages should be contained in this build...
