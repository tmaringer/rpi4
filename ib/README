        20210623 add files tarball
                 lessen need to extract rootfs
                 to examine source


        -build generator specific folder - wip




        OVERVIEW - in a nutshell

            this build is created using the imagebuilder



        KEY-NON-STANDARD-MODS

            -.config&PARTSIZEx2 ( see ibbuildinformation.txt )
        
            -image/Makefile adds updated elf+dat to the
             *boot* partition

            -( well rootfs too and some other custom imgs are
             made also but this is not critical )


        THEREST

            -most of the rest of the build customisation is
             done via files... which are a real wip
             but can be found in rtfs imgs

            -a few statix binaries are included within files

                + busybox-static ( top-mcpu, base64, shred etc.  )
                + nano ( for color ) + color profiles
                + ooklaspeedtest and ffmpeg are git-getted.sh to
                  save space

            -on occasion out of tree ipk's are also present in
             files and installed during firstboot

                -luci-theme-argon
                -mwan3-master-pr's (no longer needed)
                -etc. etc.

        
        Unforunately, git wont store a re-tarred ibdir.tar.gz
        (size) so i'm unable to upload re-usable imagebuilders...
        which was/is something i'd like to do on occasion...



        REUSE

            -dependant on certain packages... checks are
             in place in most spots but no doubt there
             are many that are missed;


                DEPENDSSTRICT

                -L1 curl, wget, httping
                    bash probably
                    maybe a pstool such as pgrep et. al.

                -L2 mostfstools: blkid, parted, fdisk, sfdisk etc
                    fsck


                DEPENDSLIKELY

                -S1 dnsmasq-full, ipset, kmod-ipt-hashlimit etc. etc.
                    a few more things related to above... conntrack maybe

                -L3 telnet, jq, 
                    sshfs/client-utils et. al. one of them anyway


                DEPENDSCONDITIONAL

                more packages depending on calling certain scripts/features


            NOTES: avoid install procps-top/du/df etc.
                    same goes for coreutils-PROGUSEDHEAVILY i.e. tar
                    
                    202101 gzip(full) breaks upgrade
                    202101 ucert breaks sysupgrade
